Non-State Conservation lands are real property permanently protected from future development by fee simple ownership, conservation or other restrictive easements, or deed restrictions held or enforceable by recognized land protection organizations other than the State of Rhode Island.  These include, but are not limited to, the Audubon Society of Rhode Island, The Nature Conservancy, RI municipal governments, The United States Fish & Wildlife Service, private land trusts and other conservation groups.

In addition to permanent legally conserved land, a number of properties documented in this dataset are included in a category called "Conservation Intent."  This designation applies to areas such as local parks, recreation areas, or lands associated with cluster sub-division developments that are not strictly protected  by a fee simple or easement interest held by a recognized conservation organization.  Instead they are considered protected by the good-will of the owners (both municipal and private) to prevent or restrict future development beyond the existing use.
