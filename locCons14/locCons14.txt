  Description:
    Abstract: Non-State Conservation lands are real property permanently protected from future development by fee simple ownership, conservation or other restrictive easements, or deed restrictions held or enforceable by recognized land protection organizations other than the State of Rhode Island.  These include, but are not limited to, the Audubon Society of Rhode Island, The Nature Conservancy, RI municipal governments, The United States Fish & Wildlife Service, private land trusts and other conservation groups.
    Purpose: General reference for planning purposes and small scale cartographic output
    Supplemental_Information: In addition to permanent legally conserved land, a number of properties documented in this dataset are included in a category called "Conservation Intent."  This designation applies to areas such as local parks, recreation areas, or lands associated with cluster sub-division developments that are not strictly protected  by a fee simple or easement interest held by a recognized conservation organization.  Instead they are considered protected by the good-will of the owners (both municipal and private) to prevent or restrict future development beyond the existing use.

        No testing was done to assess the positional accuracy of the data and no representation is claimed regarding the accuracy or suitablity of the data for any pupose other than indicated elsewhere in this document and below
        Positional data were derived from either digital geospatial Assessors Parcel records or scanned/georeferenced hard-copy Assessors Parcel Maps.  These sources reflect a broad continuum of source scale and accuracy.  Their primary purpose is to provide a reference to a property's general dimensions and location relative to surrounding properties and public infrastructure.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Property boundary delineations were derived from a variety of sources including:
        Municipal Tax Assessors data in GIS format
        Scanned and Georegistered Paper Tax Assessors Maps
        Digital and/or Scanned and Georegistered Survey Documents
        Hand drawn sketches
        Attributes were drawn from:
        Tax Assessors on-line sources
        Visits with local Planners & Tax Assessors and with the responsible land conservation organizations.
        All data was reviewed for accuracy by local sources.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Data contributed to RIGIS by the University of Rhode Island Environmental Data Center. Metadata reviewed, minor corrections made to formatting, RIGIS distribution information added.

      Attribute_Definition: Attribute Confidence.  Like the Geographic Confidence value,  this is a qualitative term describing our comfort with the descriptive data attributes included for each polygon.  We found that there we often conflicts between the local assessors data and information provided by the fee or easement owner.  While we'd like to believe that the Tax Assessors record should be the final arbiter in these situations, we've learned that non-taxable conservation lands rate fairly low on many assessors priority listing.
